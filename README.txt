# Example Project Documentation Guideline

> Include here a brief description of the project, what technologies are used etc.

## Milestone 1

- Answer some of these questions in the next few bullet points. What have you built? What technologies have you used? Why have you used those?

- Example: The FastAPI framework allows for fast and easy construction of APIs and is combined with pydantic, which is used to assert the data types of all incoming data to allow for easier processing later on. The server is ran locally using uvicorn, a library for ASGI server implementation.
  
```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

> Insert an image/screenshot of what you have built so far here.

## Milestone 2

- Does what you have built in this milestone connect to the previous one? If so explain how. What technologies are used? Why have you used them? Have you run any commands in the terminal? If so insert them using backticks (To get syntax highlighting for code snippets add the language after the first backticks).

- Example below:

```git
git add .
```

- The above command is used to stage a file for the commit by adding files in the local folder to the Git repository

```



## Milestone n

- I have gained a foundational understanding on how to create a git repo and how to commit files on a local computer into the Git repository

- I also gained a brief idea of the use of teachable machine app.

## Conclusions

- The project was to interact with the computer using the tyeachable app to create the game rock paper and scissors. 
A lot remains unexplained and for a person just starting off in IT, the process appears daunting especially when asking questions on Slack and the gurus assume we all have the same knowledge base
it would be appreciated if videos are made available for students to actually learn and not feel stupid asking simple quesdtions on Slack, Again, not encouraging
